# OSS Training from GT OSPO

![GT OSPO logo](img/logo-gt-ospo.png)

This repo contains topical training modules for getting started with open source software development.

The training modules are Jupyter Notebooks.  You can read them like a book, or you can download and run them interactively in a Jupyter session.

### Reading them

You can look at the training notebooks using the file browser in GitHub.  If GitHub's Jupyter notebook viewer misbehaves, you can use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/).  Here are direct links to the training notebooks through nbviewer:

- [Module 01: Git basics](https://nbviewer.org/github/gt-ospo/oss-training/blob/main/oss-module-01-git.ipynb)

### Running them

All training notebooks require the `jupyter` Python package.  Some may require additional packages (such as `bash_kernel`).  See the intro section of each notebook for details.
